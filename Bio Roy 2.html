<p>Some of my big family lives in Tangerang City. I often go there at the holiday to meet my cousins. I have a lot of cousins in my age, because my parent is a 10 siblings and there are 5 families lives in Tangerang in the same region, the rest of them are spreaded across the country. Some in Medan, Batam even Singapore  </p>
